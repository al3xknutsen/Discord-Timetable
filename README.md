# Discord-Timetable

This was a small project primarily developed to learn the Python Discord API. The idea was to have a timetable bot installed in my most frequently used Discord server(s), with commands for showing the timetable for one day or an entire week, registering absence, and more.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3
* discord (Python module)
